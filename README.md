# NGO-Donor-Volunteer-Management-CRM
    PROBLEM STATEMENT : NGOs face issues with tracking donors, managing funds, assigning volunteers, and reporting impact.
 Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
 Goal: To understand what challenges NGOs face in managing donors, volunteers, and funds, and how
 a CRM can make their work easier and more transparent.
 
 Requirement Gathering
 • “We have so many donors, but we don’t have one place to see their history and preferences.”
 • “We spend hours generating receipts and sending thank-you messages manually.”
 • “Funds get spread across multiple projects, but it’s hard to track exactly where they went.”
 • “Volunteers sign up to help, but managing their schedules is chaotic.”
 • “Our donors want to know the impact of their contribution, we need clear reports.”
 So, the system must:
 • Track all donors and their donations.
 • Generate automated receipts.
 • Show where money is being used.
 • Manage volunteer records and schedules.
 • Produce impact reports that can be shared with donors.
 
 Stakeholder Analysis
 • Admin: Sets up Salesforce and makes sure everything works smoothly.
 • NGO Manager: Wants a big-picture view — which projects are running, how much funding is
 available, and what outcomes have been achieved.
 • Donor Relations Officer: Wants to maintain good relationships with donors, thank them, and
 encourage them to keep contributing.
 • Volunteer Coordinator: Needs to schedule volunteers, assign them to events, and make sure they
 feel valued.
 • Finance Team: Cares about receipts, compliance, and ensuring money is properly allocated.
 • Donors: Want to know their money is being used well and transparently.
 • Volunteers: Want to contribute their time but need clarity about when, where, and how they are
 needed.

 Business Process Mapping
 1. A donor contributes (maybe online, maybe in person).
 2. Their details and the donation are logged in the CRM.
 3. A receipt is instantly generated and emailed to them, along with a thank-you note.
 4. The NGO allocates the donation to a project; for example, “Child Education Drive.”
 5. Volunteers are assigned shifts to execute the project.
 6. Once the project is done, an impact report (like “200 children received books”) is generated.
 7. This report is sent back to the donor, so they feel connected and motivated to support again.

 Industry-specific Use Case Analysis
 • Donors give money, but they want to see trust and transparency.
 • Funds are usually tied to specific causes or campaigns, so tracking is essential.
 • Volunteers are as important as funds — without them, projects don’t succeed.
 • NGOs must show impact (numbers, stories, outcomes) to survive and grow.

 AppExchange Exploration
 There are existing nonprofit apps (like Salesforce Nonprofit Success Pack - NPSP). But for learning,
 we’ll build a simplified custom CRM with objects for Donors, Volunteers, Donations, Campaigns, and
 Fund Allocation
